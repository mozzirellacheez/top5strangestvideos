         <p>
         On February 24, 2019, after reaching 300 "Sitting and Smiling" videos, Bennett began a new video series entitled "Walking and Talking", in which he walks and talks continuously for four hours, or until his camera battery runs out. He speaks in an extemporaneous and reflexive manner, describing his subjective experience in real time, with subjects such as philosophy of mind, consciousness, and nonduality arising out of his self-reflection.

   <p id="dinner">"Dining Table or nothing"</p>
   <hr>
    <p>
        This 1-minute short film was created by David B. Earle, and uploaded on his YouTube channel in 2006. The film begins focusing on a gray-skinned girl in a dining room, spoon in hand. A fire can be seen in the background. She slowly opens her eyes and begins talking backwards: ".gnihton si erehT" As the camera zooms out to the table, she faceplants in her bowl. The camera fixates on the scene before reversing. The girl returns to her previous position, and she says: "There is nothing." She then closes her eyes again, ending the film. The film is meant to show a scenario that can be infinitely looped.

    <p>"Elisa lam"</p>
    <hr>
    <P>On February 19, 2013, the body of Chinese-Canadian tourist Elisa Lam (Chinese: 藍可兒; born Lam Ho-yi) was recovered from a large cistern atop the Stay on Main hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, where she had been a guest. She was last seen alive on January 31 and was reported missing by her parents on February 1. Her body was discovered by a hotel maintenance worker investigating complaints of flooding and low water pressure.[2][3]

        Interest in Lam's disappearance increased on February 13 when the Los Angeles Police Department released security camera footage of her behaving erratically in a hotel elevator on the day she was last seen alive. The video went viral.[4][5] While an autopsy performed on February 21 was inconclusive in determining the manner of Lam's death,[6] the Los Angeles County Coroner's office subsequently ruled the death an accident with bipolar disorder being a significant contributing factor.[7]
        
        Guests at the Stay on Main sued the hotel over the incident and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015. Some of the early Internet interest noted what were considered to be unusual similarities between Lam's death and the 2002 horror film Dark Water.[3] The case has since been referenced in international popular culture and been the subject of several creative works.</P>

    <p>I feel Fantastic</p>
    <p>I Feel Fantastic is a video first uploaded to YouTube in 2009 by YouTube user Creepyblog. It features an animatronic robot named Tara singing a song about how she feels fantastic. The reason why this is creepy due to Tara's appearance and voice and the random pan-zoom into the yard. This video created theories floating around on the Internet.</p>
